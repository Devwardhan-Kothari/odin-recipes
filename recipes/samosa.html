        <img src="./../images/samosa.jpg" alt="A plate of air fryed samosas" height="800" width="1000">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Firstly, we will prepare a base potato filling. Then we will complete the filling with onions, garlic and peas. Next we fill the now finished potato filling into woton wrappers and fold them in their signature shape. Finally we fry these samosas in an air fryer making them ready to eat with an optional cilantro-yogurt sauce.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Samosa</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>

            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
            <li>2/3 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>24 wonton wrappers
            cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cilantro-yogurt sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup whole-milk Greek-style yogurt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lime zest</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add potatoes to a small saucepan and cover with salted water; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain and transfer potatoes to a bowl; mash until mostly smooth with a few small chunks remaining.</li>
            <li>In the same saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in ginger and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add garam masala, cumin, salt, and (if using) cayenne; cook about 30 seconds more. Stir in mashed potatoes and peas; cook until warmed through. Remove from heat; stir in cilantro.</li>
            <li>Arrange wonton wrappers on a clean work surface; evenly spoon filling into centers of wontonwrappers. Lightly wet borders of wrappers with water. Fold two corners together to form triangles. Press edges to seal. Coat both sides of samosas with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat air fryer basket with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Working in batches if needed, arrange samosas in an even layer in the basket. Cook, turning once halfway through, until samosas are golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine yogurt, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice; garlic, salt and pepper in a small food processor; process until well combined. Chill, covered, up to 5 days.</li> 
            <li>Serve samosas with cilantro-yogurt sauce. Garnish with additional cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
